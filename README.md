## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a multidisciplinary developer passionate about building robust, scalable systems that blend intelligence, design, and purpose. With a strong foundation in operating systems, machine learning, and creative storytelling, I aim to contribute innovative solutions at the intersection of technology and human experience.

Currently participating in the **NASA Space Apps Challenge Noida 2025**, where I'm leading the development of **CoLLM**, a collaborative agent-based AI model for space mission simulations.
